## Features

### Dashboard Statistics

- **Main Statistics Dashboard** - Four color-coded tiles showing your most important Pi-hole metrics:
  - Total DNS Queries
  - Queries Blocked
  - Block Percentage
  - Domains on Blocklists

![Dashboard Statistics](assets/dashboard-stats.png)

### Additional Metrics

- **Client Statistics** - See active clients, unique domains, unique clients, etc.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]  
> Before using this card, please ensure you have the [Pi-hole v6 integration](https://github.com/bastgau/ha-pi-hole-v6) installed in your Home Assistant instance.

### HACS (Recommended)

[![HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=homeassistant-extras&repository=pi-hole-card&category=dashboard)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click the menu icon in the top right and select "Custom repositories"
3. Add this repository URL and select "Dashboard" as the category
   - `https://github.com/homeassistant-extras/pi-hole-card`
4. Click "Install"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `pi-hole-card.js` file from the latest release in the Releases tab.
2. Copy it to your `www/community/pi-hole-card/` folder
3. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` (or add as a resource in dashboards menu)

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/community/pi-hole-card/pi-hole-card.js
      type: module
```

## Usage

Add the card to your dashboard using the UI editor or YAML:

### Card Editor

The card is fully configurable through the card editor, allowing you to customize:

- Pi-hole device selection
- Card title and icon
- Custom actions for statistics, info panels, and control buttons

![editor](assets/editor.png)

### YAML

This is the most minimal configuration needed to get started:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: your_pihole_device_id
```

The card will automatically:

- Detect all Pi-hole entities associated with the device
- Organize statistics in the dashboard layout
- Display control buttons for common actions
- Show version information for all components

## Configuration Options

| Name             | Type   | Default      | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| device_id        | string | **Required** | The ID of your Pi-hole device in Home Assistant |
| title            | string | Pi-Hole      | Custom title for the card header                |
| icon             | string | mdi:pi-hole  | Custom icon for the card header                 |
| stats            | object | _none_       | Configure actions for statistics tiles          |
| info             | object | _none_       | Configure actions for additional info items     |
| controls         | object | _none_       | Configure actions for control buttons           |
| exclude_sections | list   | _none_       | Sections of entities to exclude. See below.     |
| exclude_entities | list   | _none_       | Entities to remove from the card.               |

### Action Configuration

Each section (stats, info, controls) supports the following action types:

| Name              | Type   | Default    | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| tap_action        | object | _optional_ | Action to perform when tapped        |
| hold_action       | object | _optional_ | Action to perform when held          |
| double_tap_action | object | _optional_ | Action to perform when double-tapped |

Actions can be configured to perform various operations such as:

- Toggle entities
- Show more info
- Call services
- Navigate to different views
- And more!

### Section Options

The following section names can be used with `exclude_sections`:

- header
- statistics
- sensors
- controls
- footer

### Auto-discovery

The card automatically discovers and identifies all Pi-hole entities based on:

- Entity naming patterns
- Translation keys
- Entity relationships to the device

This includes sensors, buttons, switches, binary sensors, and update entities.

## Example Configurations

```

### With Custom Title and Icon

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
title: 'My Pi-hole Server'
icon: 'mdi:shield-check'
```

#### Excluding Sections & Entities

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
exclude_sections:
  - sensors
  - controls
exclude_entities:
  - button.pi_hole_action_refresh_data
  - sensor.pi_hole_latest_data_refresh
```
