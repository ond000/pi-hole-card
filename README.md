![filtering](assets/filtering.png)

### Multi-Pi-hole Support

- **Centralized Control** - Manage multiple Pi-hole instances from a single card
- **Aggregated Status** - See at a glance how many of your Pi-holes are active
- **Unified Control** - Centralized access to all switches from your Pi-hole instances
- **Intelligent Status Indicators** - Status automatically adjusts based on collective state:
  - Shows "Running" when all instances are active
  - Shows "Partial" when some instances are active and some are inactive
  - Shows count of active instances (e.g., "2/3")

Example of Partial
![Multi Pi-hole Status](assets/multi-pihole-partial.png)

Example of all Running
![Multi Pi-hole All Running](assets/multi-pihole-running.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> The multi-Pi-hole feature currently has some limitations:
>
> - Statistics shown are from the first Pi-hole in the list only
> - All switches from all Pi-holes are displayed in a single list
> - Only header status reflects the multi-Pi-hole state

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-friendly** - Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Fluid Layout** - Responsive design adapts to available space

## Installation

### Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]  
> Before using this card, please ensure you have the [Pi-hole v6 integration](https://github.com/bastgau/ha-pi-hole-v6) installed in your Home Assistant instance.

### HACS (Recommended)

[![HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=homeassistant-extras&repository=pi-hole-card&category=dashboard)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click the menu icon in the top right and select "Custom repositories"
3. Add this repository URL and select "Dashboard" as the category
   - `https://github.com/homeassistant-extras/pi-hole-card`
4. Click "Install"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `pi-hole-card.js` file from the latest release in the Releases tab.
2. Copy it to your `www/community/pi-hole-card/` folder
3. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` (or add as a resource in dashboards menu)

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/community/pi-hole-card/pi-hole-card.js
      type: module
```

## Usage

Add the card to your dashboard using the UI editor or YAML:

### Card Editor

The card is fully configurable through the card editor, allowing you to customize:

- Pi-hole device selection (single or multiple)
- Card title and icon
- Custom actions for statistics, info panels, and control buttons

![editor](assets/editor.png)

### YAML

This is the most minimal configuration needed to get started:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: your_pihole_device_id
```

For multiple Pi-hole instances:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id:
  - your_first_pihole_device_id
  - your_second_pihole_device_id
  - etc..
```

The card will automatically:

- Detect all Pi-hole entities associated with the device(s)
- Organize statistics in the dashboard layout
- Display control buttons for common actions
- Show version information for all components
- For multiple Pi-holes: combine switches and show aggregated status

### Finding Your Device ID

If you're unsure what your Pi-hole device ID is, here are several ways to find it:

#### Method 1: Use the Card Editor (Recommended)

1. Add the card through the visual editor
2. Select your Pi-hole device from the dropdown
3. Click "Show Code Editor" or "View YAML" to see the generated configuration
4. Copy the `device_id` value for use in manual YAML configuration

#### Method 2: Devices Page

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Devices**
2. Search for "Pi-hole" or browse to find your Pi-hole device
3. Click on the device and look at the URL - the device ID will be in the URL path

### Switch Spacing Options

The `switch_spacing` option controls how switches are arranged in the switches section:

- flex (default): Switches flow naturally with standard flexbox behavior
- space-around: Equal space around each switch
- space-between: Maximum space between switches, no space at edges

### Auto-discovery

The card automatically discovers and identifies all Pi-hole entities based on:

- Entity naming patterns
- Translation keys
- Entity relationships to the device

This includes sensors, buttons, switches, binary sensors, and update entities.

## Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
```

### Multiple Pi-hole Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id:
  - pi_hole_device_1
  - pi_hole_device_2
title: 'My Pi-hole Network'
```

### With Custom Title and Icon

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
title: 'My Pi-hole Server'
icon: 'mdi:shield-check'
```

### With Custom Pause Durations

The `pause_durations` configuration supports various formats for specifying time:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
pause_durations:
  - 60 # 1 minute
  - 300 # 5 minutes
  - 10s # 10 seconds
  - 5m # 5 minutes
  - 1h # 1 hour
  - '4h:20m:69s' # 15669 seconds (complex format)
```

**Supported time formats:**

- **Numbers**: Interpreted as seconds (e.g., `300` = 5 minutes)
- **Number strings**: Quoted numbers treated as seconds (e.g., `"60"` = 1 minute)
- **Simple units**: Time with single unit (e.g., `"10s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h"`)
- **Complex format**: Colon-separated with units (e.g., `"1h:30m:45s"`)

The UI will automatically display these in human-readable format (e.g., "5 minutes", "1 hour").

## Feature Flags

Use feature flags to customize card behavior:

```yaml
features:
  - disable_group_pausing
```

| Feature               | Description                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| disable_group_pausing | Disable group pausing feature |

### Group Pausing Feature

The group pausing feature is **enabled by default**. When enabled, the pause section will show a dropdown to select which pi or client group to pause, allowing you to pause individual instances or client groups. This is useful for targeting specific Pi-hole instances or client groups.

![group-pause](assets/group-pause.gif)

When enabled you can pause the Pi instance as well

![pi-pause](assets/pi-pause.gif)

> [!NOTE]  
> **Prerequisites**: This feature requires the [Pi-hole v6 integration](https://github.com/bastgau/ha-pi-hole-v6) to be installed in your Home Assistant instance.

> [!WARNING]  
> **HA Core Integration**: This feature has not been tested with the Home Assistant Core Pi-hole integration and may not work as expected.

To disable the group pausing feature and use the legacy device-based service call (which pauses all Pi-hole devices). This is reccomended for multi-pi situations:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
features:
  - disable_group_pausing
```

### Excluding Sections & Entities

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
exclude_sections:
  - sensors
  - switches
exclude_entities:
  - button.pi_hole_action_refresh_data
  - sensor.pi_hole_latest_data_refresh
```

### With Custom Actions

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
title: 'Network Protection'
stats:
  tap_action:
    action: more-info
  hold_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: /lovelace/network
controls:
  tap_action:
    action: toggle
  hold_action:
    action: more-info
```

### With Custom Badge Actions

The card icon/badge supports custom actions that can override the default diagnostic message behavior:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
badge:
  tap_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: /lovelace/pi-hole-dashboard
  hold_action:
    action: call-service
    perform_action: browser_mod.popup
    data:
      title: Pi-hole Status
      content: 'Quick overview of Pi-hole status'
  double_tap_action:
    action: more-info
    entity_id: sensor.pi_hole_status
```

### With Switch Toggle and Pause Actions

For quick Pi-hole control, you can configure the badge to toggle the main switch on tap and pause for 30 seconds on hold:

```yaml
type: custom:pi-hole
device_id: pi_hole_device_1
badge:
  tap_action:
    action: perform-action
    perform_action: switch.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: switch.pi_hole
  hold_action:
    action: perform-action
    perform_action: pi_hole_v6.disable
    data:
      device_id: pi_hole_device_1
      duration: '00:00:30'
  double_tap_action:
    action: more-info
    entity_id: switch.pi_hole
```

> [!NOTE]  
> **Default Badge Behavior**: If no custom `badge` actions are configured, the card will automatically:
>
> - **Tap**: Purge diagnostic messages (when messages exist) or show more info (when no messages)
> - **Hold/Double-tap**: Show more info about the diagnostic message entity
>
> **Requirements**: Both `purge_diagnosis_messages` and `info_message_count` entities must be enabled for the default behavior to work.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Multi-Pi-hole Action Behavior**: When using multiple Pi-hole instances, actions are executed for each configured Pi-hole. This can lead to unexpected behavior:
>
> - **More-info actions**: Only one dialog can be open at a time, so you may only see info for the first or last Pi-hole
> - **Navigation actions**: Multiple navigation attempts may conflict with each other
> - **Service calls**: Will be executed for all Pi-holes, which may or may not be desired
>
> Consider using single-entity actions or service calls with specific targeting when configuring multi-Pi-hole setups.
